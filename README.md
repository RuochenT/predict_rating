# predict rating
The primary objective of this project was to address the issue of data sparsity in the hotel dataset prior to applying collaborative filtering techniques. The rating values were dropped by 30 percent randomly in order to conduct the experiment. Subsequently, the user ratings were predicted based on the reviews utilizing BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet models.
